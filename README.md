# Calculator
When it comes to operations on numbers nothing can help more than a calculator I have developed this project using Java language which can perform some basic operations on numbers like addition ,subtraction, multiplication,division and modulus
For the development of this project i have used loop , switch ,scanner object concept . 
For running this code, directly copy the entire code and paste it in some online java compiler . 
flow of execution :
 when you will run this code ,you will be asked to 
 1) Enter the first Number // put 1st number
 2) Enter the second Number // put second number
 3) choose operation to perform // choose the opertaion you want  and thats it 
 4) You will get your result displaying on your screen .
